Project19
GUI programming and face recognition/identification with Python.

core functionality {
	recognize and identify the faces of the students enrolled in a specific module.
	recording time of arrival of the students given the time schedule once the face of the student is identified.
	statistical data such as how many students have attended for the current session and who are missing.
	how many classes are missed by a specific student.
	// addition
	student information database{
		Face 
		Student id
	}
	management log in, set lecture time, search data from particular lecture or student.
	adminstrator log in, set parameter to adjust accuracy.
}

tasks {
	1) overall system design;
	2) face recognition design and development, data related function design and development;
	3) GUI design and development;
	4) testing at different levels
}

meeting 1 {
	formal meeting time schedual
	time plan
	website functionality
	open source library or codes
	exist hardware or buy new one
	a camera or anything else
	database/data structure
	accuracy
}

Week 1 {
	time plan
	use case diagram
	website design
	python
}

meeting 2 {
	Done{
		website			// not finished yet
		use case diagram
		time plan 		// gantt chart
	}
	Todo{
		user requirement specification
	}
	prototype and UI design
}

Week 2 {
	Todo{
		requirement analysis
		class diagram
		component diagram
		sequence diagram
		UI design
		camera function
	}
	use case diagram{
		// need to be more detailed
		change 'view' to 'search'
		change 'face info' to 'image'
		change 'modify' to 'add / delete / update'
	}
	Software Process Models{
		use water-fall model process
		first design, then develop
	}
	four parts{
		//develop seperate parts and then integrate 
		UI, DB, camera based and DB based
	}
}

meeting 3{
	check timeline
	check usecase diagram
	check class diagram
}

week 3 {
	Modify the class diagram {
		// about name format
		the first letter of class name should all be in capital and use only one word: TeachingSession
		the first letter of attribute in the class should all be in lower-case: groupID
		// about all the controller class
		the relationship between Teacher class and TeacherController class should be Inheritance(trangle arrow)
		the relationship between Admin class and AdminController class should be Inheritance(trangle arrow)
		the relationship between Teacher class, Admin class and PublicControl class should be Inheritance(trangle arrow)
		// about Module class
		the relationship between Student class and Module class should be Aggregation(hollow diamond)
		the relationship between Module class and Group class should be Composition(solid diamond)
		// about Teacher class
		the relationship between Teacher class and Module class should be Association(single arrow)
		link Teacher class and TeachingSession class using Aggregation, add [tutor:Teacher] into TeachingSession
		// about Teaching session
		the relationship between TeachingSession class and Group class should be Association(single arrow)
		// about Attendence class
		the relationship between Student class and Attendence class can be removed
		// about FaceFetector class
		the relationship between TeacherController class and FaceDetector class？
		the relationship between FaceDetector class and attendence class？
		// about attribute
		in Module class: tutor should be Arraylist<Teacher>
		in Module/Group class: enrolledStudent should be Arraylist<Student>
		in Attendence class: attendStudent can be removed
		// about method
		in FaceDetector class should have identify, reconigize, record and sendComfirmation method
		// about main method
		where to put main method
	}
	Modify timeline
	Modify use case diagram
}

meeting 4{
	class diagram
	link to the database
	UI design
}

week 4{
	UI design for log in page and teacher page.
	Modify class diagram {
		reconsider the relationship between the classes
		reconsider where to put the method
	}
}

meeting 5{
	Todo{
		delete type in log in page
		teacher cannot delete the lecture
		resume function
		general search show everything correctly
		have a summary of the attendence of the student
		searching for student with the same name
		detailed student attendence information
		need to be easy to change the status
		add command for changing
		start a session when time is wrong
		add time and rate on the record page
		summary for the session/module/student
		if cannot be recognized(can take a photo and add command)
		class diagram{
			people - public controller
			rename public controller -> general
			rename people -> staff
		}
		sequence diagram
		market research
	}
}
